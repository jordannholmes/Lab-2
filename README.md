# Zebra <br>
***Equus Quagg*** <br>
   + The primary reason they have black and white stripes is for camouflage purposes. <br>
   + Zebras eat leaves and grass. They must have water to survive, with at minimum one drink a day. <br>
   + If a zebra is wounded, its family will always come to its defense circling the injured zebra and trying to scare off any predators. <br>
   + Zebras are responsible for more injuries to United States zookeepers than any other animal found within a zoo. <br>
   + Zebras combine their speed with zig-zagging motions and excellent speed and stamina to try and escape predators who chase them. <br>
   + Zebras and ostriches usually live together to protect one another from the predators, which they commonly share. <br>
